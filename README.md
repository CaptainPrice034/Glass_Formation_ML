Machine Learning-Based prediction of reduced glass transition temperature from MAGPIE features

This project focuses on developing machine learning models to predict the glass formation ability (GFA) of metallic alloys. Since the reduced glass transition temperature (Trg) is a crucial dimensionless indicator of glass formation ability, the primary goal is to accurately model and predict reduced glass transition temperature (Trg) based on alloy compositions represented through MAGPIE features.

To ensure model robustness, highly correlated input features (correlation coefficient ≥ 0.95) were removed to avoid redundancy and multicollinearity issues. Multiple machine learning algorithms will be explored to predict both Trg values and the overall glass-forming ability of alloys. Also, Explainable AI (XAI) techniques will be integrated to interpret model decisions and uncover composition–property relationships, providing deeper scientific insight into metallic glass formation.

Dataset
The dataset was assembled by Vanessa Nilsen under the supervision of Prof. Dane Morgan at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, containing composition-based feature descriptors and experimentally measured Trg values.
